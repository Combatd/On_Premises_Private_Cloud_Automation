# On_Premises_Private_Cloud_Automation
Nutanix Private Cloud Training for SaaS 3 Tier Web Architecture - Software as a Service

## Project - Private Cloud SaaS: Three-Tier Web Application
In the project at the end of the On Premises Private Cloud Automation course, I will:

* Create a three-tier web application blueprint that satisfies the IaaS business requirements for self-service private cloud deployment and security scenarios.
* Enhance the blueprint to provide PaaS by configuring the web application and creating web-tier scaling. Test the web application works by confirming scale-out load balancing across the web tier and database write updates.
* Enhance the blueprint to provide an action to update the database password and update the web application to use the new password, achieving a SaaS-like experience for developers with delegated, post deployment operations. Test the web application works with the new password.
